INSTALLATION
======================================

Copy ValveLemonLDAPNG.jar in <TOMCAT_HOME>/server/lib

Add on your server.xml file a new valve entry like this (in host section):

<Valve className="org.lemonLDAPNG.SSOValve" userKey="AUTH-USER" roleKey="AUTH-ROLE" roleSeparator="," allows="127.0.0.1" passThrough="true"/>

Configure attributes :
- userKey: Key in the HTTP header sent by LemonLDAP::NG containing user login
- roleKey: Key in the HTTP header sent by LemonLDAP::NG containing roles. If LemonLDAP send some roles split by some commas, use roleSeparator
* roleSeparator: See above
* allows: You can filter remote IP. IP defined in this attribute are allowed (use "," separator for multiple IP).  Just set the LemonLDAP::NG server IP in this attribute in order to add more security. If this attribute is missed, all hosts are allowed.
* passThrough: Allow anonymous access or not. When it takes "false", HTTP headers have to be sent by LemonLDAP::NG to make authentication and if the user is not recognized or HTTP headers not present, a 403 error is send. If "true", HTTP requests without headers will pass trough the valve (use with caution).
